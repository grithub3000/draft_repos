With this program, 2 teams of 2 players will take turns drafting a character
from a video game. After the predetermined amount of characters have been 
drafted from each player, the user can select from 2 different modes:

Inputting 's' will assign each player one random character from the list of 
ALL characters that have been drafted.

Inputting 'i' will assign each player one random character from the list of 
characers that he/she personally drafted. 

After the characters have been assigned, the user is given the option to 
either reassign each player another random character, switch modes, redraft
characters with the same teams, or exit the program.
